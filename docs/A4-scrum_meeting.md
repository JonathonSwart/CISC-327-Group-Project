# Jeevan:
1. What is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).
- Jeevan completed his work on the jeevan-dev branch.
2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2).
- So far, Jeevan has completed test cases for the following 3 requirements, R1-1 which
has a test cases using black box output coverage method. R1-3 which is using input
partioning testing. Finally, R1-4 which is using test cases involving blackbox
output coverage. All of these test cases have been pushed to the branch.
3. Any difficulties?
- The only difficulties Jeevan was facing revolved around setting up selenium to work
with the project.
4. What is the plan for the days before the deadline.
- Jeevan's plan for the days before the deadline mainly revolve around figuring out
how to get a third black box testing method incorporated into his test cases.

# Ash:
1. What is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).
- Ash worked in the branch Ash-dev.
2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2).
- Progress has been that  first few test cases for creat_listing requirment r4-1,r4-2,r4-3, are done and pushed to the remote branch. Black box methods used are : partition input, partition input + shotgun, output testing.
3. Any difficulties?
- No difficulties.
4. What is the plan for the days before the deadline.
- The plan for the next few days is to just add in the rest of the requirements for create_listing. That is r4_4, r4_5, r4_8

# Jonathon:
1. What is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).
- Jonathon worked in jonathon-dev. 
2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2).
- Completed the login test cases and comitted to branch. Black box method used for login test cases are output partitioning.
3. Any difficulties?
- No difficulties.
4. What is the plan for the days before the deadline.
-  Jonathon will be using input partitioning and functionality coverage for the testing requirements for updating a users profile. Jonathon will be completing these test cases in the next day or two.

# Luca:
1. What is the branch he/she worked on (has to be pushed to the repo).
- Luca is working on the 'Luca-dev' branch.
2. What is the progress so far (at least some test cases written, more than 2).
- So far he has written 5 test cases. As a result, he completed output partition testing, and is in the process of completing  functionality testing.
3. Any difficulties?
- So far the difficulties being had was running into many front end errors that prevented appropriate testing from being done.
4. What is the plan for the days before the deadline.
- At this point, the plan is to fix the front end bugs, and from there, complete the functionality testing. From there, I would complete shotgun testing. Once this is done, three different black box testing methods will be completed, thus satisfying the initial plan.
